# PL4246HM_Final_Report_Data_Repositry

The main aim for this project was analyse the structure of a social network of university students, and find out what demographic characteristics have homophily in the network and understand how that shapes the network. Additionally, the homogeneity of connections was analysed and compared between male and female students, to see if the different genders had differing homophilic tendencies.

'Data' contains all the datasets from the student survey responses, including the student names, demographic information and numeric labels. 

'Social Network Dataset.R' contains all code for the statistical calculations and plots used in the research report. 

'Supplementary Files' contains a condensed list of the survey responses as well as a summary table of the number of students in the various demographic groups.
